# Import Freemind to XMind #

If you're a freemind user, it's really a good news. XMind is a new
open source project to do brainstorming and mind mapping. Now you can
import your freemind maps to XMind, in order to:

  * add attachment files into mindmaps.
  * add my pictures and markers into mindmaps.
  * add fishbone diagrams into mindmaps.
  * add spreadsheets into mindmaps, and treat them as topics.
  * add a legend to show user defined descriptions to each marker.
  * add rich text notes
  * drilldown into a topic, and focus on it.
  * import mindmaps from Mindmanager.
  * share mindmaps with the world, via [Share.xmind.net](http://share.xmind.net/) (like YouTube).
